# cordova-elements
[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) allows us to use native device features (like Camera, Contacts, Notification, GPS etc.) with Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).

`cordova-elements` are wrappers around cordova, turning it into a set of high quality web components made with Polymer.

Native device features are now as simple as changing attributes and methods on DOM Elements.
